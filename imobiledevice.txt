Building libimobiledevice for Windows
=====================================

Get the following GitHub repositories:

Polyfun/libimobiledevice
Polyfun/libimobiledevice-windows 
Polyfun/libplist
Polyfun/libusbmuxd

This should give you the following sub-directories:

libimobiledevice
libimobiledevice-windows
libplist
libusbmuxd

Get openssl from http://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html; you need both 32 bit and 64 bit installers, 
e.g., Win32 OpenSSL v1.0.1j and Win64 OpenSSL v1.0.1j. Run the installers and choose the location as 
libimobiledevice-windows\OpenSSL-Win32 or libimobiledevice-windows\OpenSSL-x64. NOTE: THE 64 BIT INSTALLER 
INSTALLS TO OpenSSL-Win64 BY DEFAULT. THIS MUST BE CHANGED TO OpenSSL-x64 (in the libimobiledevice-windows
directory). Also choose to copy the OpenSSL directories to /bin directory.

Your libimobiledevice-windows directory should have the following sub-directories:

lib
libcnary
libgen
libiconv
libxml2
OpenSSL-Win32
OpenSSL-x64
vendors

Open the Visual Studio 2008 solution libimobiledevice-windows\imobiledevice.sln, and you should be ready to rebuild. 

There are 4 build configurations:

Debug, Win32
Release, Win32
Debug, x64
Release, x64

Although the libxml2 source is included in the libimobiledevice-windows repository I have not built it in VS 2008. 
The libxml2 source code is there to provide the headers for the other projects, and the lib directory contains 
the libxml2 import libraries.

Similarly, the libiconv source is included for the headers, but not built.
